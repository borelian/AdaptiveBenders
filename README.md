# Adaptive Benders

Source code and instances for the computational experiments of the paper "Benders Adaptive-Cuts Method for Two-Stage Stochastic Programs" by Cristian Ram√≠rez-Pico, Ivana Ljubic adn Eduardo Moreno.

It applies different Benders methods and other optimization methods to solve two stochastic network flow problem.
