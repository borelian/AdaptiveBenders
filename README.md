# Adaptive Benders

Source code and instances for the computational experiments of the paper "Benders Adaptive-Cuts Method for Two-Stage Stochastic Programs" by Cristian Ram√≠rez-Pico, Ivana Ljubic abd Eduardo Moreno.

It applies different Benders methods and other optimization methods to solve two stochastic network flow problem.

It requires NumPy library and Gurobi (https://www.gurobi.com) as optimization solver.
